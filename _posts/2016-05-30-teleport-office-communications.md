title:  Bringing offices together -- teleport
---

This was an idea that Ted threw at me last year -- a zero-friction means of starting a face-to-face video conference on an ad-hoc basis.

I've put together a [web page][http://go.kik.services/teleport], that contains links to a number of Google Hangouts (created on demand).

The zero-friction part is the conference carts, a Google Chromebox that boots into ChromeOS, once you log in, you're presented with a 
Chrome browser that loads up the page and is displayed on a monitor with a touch screen overlay. Joining a meeting is a matter of touching the 
agreed-upon meeting room.
